/**
 An `STPPaymentConfiguration` represents all the options you can set or change
 around a payment. 
 
 You provide an `STPPaymentConfiguration` object to your `STPPaymentContext` 
 when making a charge. The configuration generally has settings that
 will not change from payment to payment and thus is reusable, while the context 
 is specific to a single particular payment instance.
